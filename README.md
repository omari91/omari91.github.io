# Clifford Omari's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository.
This space highlights my work at the intersection of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, EV infrastructure optimization, and system development, showcasing research, technical builds, and results from both academic and product-operations environments.

## 🔧 About

I’m an MSc Electrical & Electronic Engineering candidate based in Berlin, Germany, and an IEEE researcher presenting at the Forum for Innovative Sustainable Transportation Systems (FISTS 2026).
My current research — “Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Optimization in Berlin: A Fuzzy Multi-Objective Framework for Robust Deployment Under Uncertainty” — focuses on improving EV-charging rollout reliability and cost efficiency.

Previously, I led Product Operations and Customer Support teams, achieving an average 87 %+ customer satisfaction score through data-driven process design, training, and cross-functional coordination.
This hybrid background allows me to connect engineering precision with operational execution — delivering systems that work in theory and in real-world deployment.

## ⚙️ Core Expertise

EV Charging Infrastructure Optimization – fuzzy multi-objective and robust modelling

Systems Design & Product Operations – scaling support processes and deployment frameworks

Data & Decision Systems – Python, MATLAB, Fuzzy Logic, and optimization algorithms
