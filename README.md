## 🔧 About

I'm an MSc Electrical & Electronic Engineering candidate based in Berlin, Germany, and an IEEE researcher.

My work spans **grid digital twins**, **EV charging infrastructure optimization**, and **real-time power systems engineering**, with a focus on German energy regulations (VDE-AR-N 4110, §14a EnWG) and production-grade implementations.

Previously, I led Product Operations and Customer Support teams, achieving an average 87%+ customer satisfaction score through data-driven process design, training, and cross-functional coordination.

This hybrid background allows me to connect engineering precision with operational execution — delivering systems that work in theory and in real-world deployment.
